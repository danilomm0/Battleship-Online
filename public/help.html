            <h2>How to Play Battleship</h2>
            <p>In the game Battleship, players take turns guessing the locations
                of their opponent's ships. The goal is to sink all of the
                opponent's ships before they sink yours.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Drag and drop your ships onto the grid to place them in your desired locations.</li>
                <li>If you'd like to save time, use the "Place Randomly" option to place ships automatically.</li>
                <li>Take turns guessing where your opponent's ships are located.</li>
                <li>If you hit an opponent’s ship, the square in which it is located will gray out.</li>
                <li>The first player to sink all of their opponent’s ships wins!</li>
            </ul>
